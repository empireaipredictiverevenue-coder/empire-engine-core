# fee_watcher

## What it does

Scaffolded. Would poll for settled-claim events from the active carrier adapter. Currently dry-run because the active adapter is the mock (disabled in production).

## When it runs

*/6 hours on :55

## What it touches

### Tables
  - `fee_events`
  - `agent_config`
  - `agent_activity`

### Files
  - `agents/fee_watcher/`

## How to run it manually

```bash
# Load the env
set -a; . /root/.env; set +a

# Run the agent
cd /root/empire-v49
/usr/bin/python3 -m agents.fee_watcher 2>&1 | tail -20
```

## How to check it worked

```sql
-- Recent runs for this agent
SELECT started_at, status, summary
FROM agent_activity
WHERE agent_name = 'fee_watcher'
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
-- Current state
SELECT enabled, dry_run, last_run_at, last_run_status
FROM agent_config
WHERE agent_name = 'fee_watcher';
```

## Common issues

- Manual trigger available via: python3 -m agents.fee_watcher.trigger --claim-amount 50000 --contractor-id <uuid>
- Real implementation requires a live carrier adapter (CoverForce, State Farm B2B, etc).
